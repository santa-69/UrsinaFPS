# Ursina FPS
a relatively simple multiplayer fps game made with python and the ursina game engine

## Dependencies
The only dependency is Ursina. Run `pip install ursina` to install the game engine or follow instructions at (https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina). I recommend to do this in a venv as it appears Ursina only runs with python version 3.12. Learn about python venv here (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## Server 
The server does not have any dependencies. You can simply run it by running the server/main.py file.
